    "# Challenge Exercise: Radar Gun \n",
    "\n",
    "With an ultrasonic sensor and some clever math, it is possible to build a \"radar gun\" that tracks the max speed of a moving object. Before getting into the code, it is important to first understand the math that allows this radar gun idea to work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think back to the distance sensing exploration. In that exercise we plotted the distance recorded by the sensor vs the time at which it took that reading. When things were moving fast, the curve was steeper, as the distance changed quicker *with respect to* time. It turns out that to measure the speed at which an object is moving, all you need to do is figure out how steep the distance vs time curve is; that is to say, you need to calculate its *slope*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing this, think about how you could write a function to return the slope between the last two points of a data set. Then, have the function loop while the ultrasonic sensor takes data and puts it into an array. The function should continually return the slope between the last two readings of the sensor. Print this reading at a readable interval so that you can see the \"speed\" at which the object is moving. Here's a template to get you started:"
